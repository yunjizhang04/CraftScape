The game uses WASD keys to move.

As a player, your goal is to craft items and survive until you are able to
escape the area via the main entrance (the big orange entrance).

You may use the dropbox on the top of the screen to craft. You will only
be able to craft items if you have the needed amount of materials.

You can get materials by 
- clicking on trees (trees have a limited supply of logs. Must wait for 
tree to replenish before getting more logs from that same tree)
	- trees have a random chance of dropping an apple. (Apples are also limited)

- clicking on the cave
	- player cannot access the cave unless they have a pickaxe.
	- players can only get stone if they have a wooden pickaxe.
	- player can get stone and iron if they have a stone pickaxe
	- players can get stone iron and gold if they have an iron pickaxe
	- caves do not have a limited supply of materials

- clicking on the river
	- you can only get water if you have a bowl

Once night comes, players will die from the cold if they do not have a fireplace.
	- you can craft a fireplace
	- your fireplace will burn out, you need to constantly supply it 
	  with logs
	- you can place the fireplace on the grey looking slab

You can skip nighttime by building a house. You can craft a house by clicking
on the black gravel looking square.

To escape, you must craft the golden key :O

Good luck and have fun!
