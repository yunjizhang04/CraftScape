# CraftScape

------------- READ ME -------------

Hello.
 **EDIT from 2024. This was the first game I created entirely by myself in 2020 (I added this to GitHub in 2024). Currently, some of the graphics is missing and I am trying to resolve the issue. Otherwise, the game works fine. ENJOY!)

This game is called Craftscape. In this game, you have to collect and craft items in order to survive and escape the area you have been put into.
The game uses WASD to move. 


Here is the recommended course of action to take when playing this game
 - collect logs
 - craft wooden pickaxe
 - collect stone
 - craft fireplace
 - place fireplace down
 - collect more logs
 - make stone pickaxe
 - collect more logs
 - if night falls, supply your fireplace with logs
 - if you want to be fancy, build a house
 - collect iron
 - make iron pickaxe
 - collect gold
 - make key
 - escape :D

These are the functionalities that are missing from my original plan
 - I removed the hunger bar... Ran out of time :d
 - I also did not include chests (although I did say that I would only include chests if I have time).
 - I did not add the press on image to craft items. I just used a drop box for the user to select items.

Bugs or errors
 - none that I've noticed so far

Some other words
 - the texts beside the character does not update as often as I'd like it to. The user also cannot tell when user collects more than one of the same materials
