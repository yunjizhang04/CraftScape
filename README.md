# CraftScape

------------- READ ME -------------

Hello.
**EDIT from 2024. This was the first game I created entirely by myself in 2020 (I added this to GitHub in 2024). Currently, some of the graphics are missing and I am trying to resolve the issue. Otherwise, the game works fine. ENJOY!)

This game is called Craftscape. In this game, you must collect and craft items to survive and escape the area you have been put into.
The game uses WASD to move. 


Here is the recommended course of action to take when playing this game
 - collect logs
 - craft wooden pickaxe
 - collect stone
 - craft fireplace
 - place fireplace down
 - collect more logs
 - make a stone pickaxe
 - collect more logs
 - if night falls, supply your fireplace with logs
 - if you want to be fancy, build a house
 - collect iron
 - make an iron pickaxe
 - collect gold
 - make key
 - escape :D

These are the functionalities that are missing from my original plan
 - I removed the hunger bar... Ran out of time :d
 - I also did not include chests (although I did say that I would only include chests if I have time).
 - I did not add the press-on image to craft items. I just used a drop box for the user to select items.

Bugs or errors
 - none that I've noticed so far

Some other words
 - the texts beside the character does not update as often as I'd like it to. The user also cannot tell when user collects more than one of the same materials


**Game Instructions**

The game uses WASD keys to move.

As a player, you aim to craft items and survive until you can escape the area via the main entrance (the big orange entrance).

You may use the dropbox on the top of the screen to craft. You can only craft items if you have the required amount of materials.

You can get materials by 
- clicking on trees (trees have a limited supply of logs. Note that you must wait for the tree to replenish before getting more logs from that same tree)
- trees have a random chance of dropping an apple. (Apples are also limited)
- clicking on the cave (Note: you must have the necessary tools to be able to mine)
- players cannot access the cave unless they have a pickaxe.
- players can only get stone if they have a wooden pickaxe.
- players can get stone and iron if they have a stone pickaxe
- players can get stone iron and gold if they have an iron pickaxe
- caves do not have a limited supply of materials
- clicking on the river with a bowl (you can only get water if you have a bowl)

Once night comes, players will die from the cold if they do not have a fireplace.
- you can craft a fireplace
- your fireplace will burn out, you must constantly supply it with logs
- you can place the fireplace on the grey-looking slab

You can skip nighttime by building a house. You can craft a house by clicking on the black gravel-looking square with the required materials in your inventory.

To escape, you must craft the golden key :O

Check your inventory for the supplies and recipes of the available items in the game!
Good luck and have fun!
